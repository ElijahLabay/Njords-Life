	<h1>Njord's Most Amazing Adventures in the World of Doom</h1>
	<p>Hi! My name is Njord. My pronouns are they/them. I am a plastic bag that has been looking for a better life. I have a purple face, always indicating to the world that I am happy, but inside I am a little depressed. I have a heavy belly, from being stretched out and filled with other people’s garbage. I am a pharmacist. I produce clean oxygen tanks for the humans to breath. Enjoy!</p>

	<p>I am full of anxiety trying to always please other people’s needs and be of use. 
I can stretch and shrink in size. I want to help clean up the earth and make the 
environment better but everyone just looks at me as the problem for the world being the way it 
is. Little do they know that I am here to help them!</p>
