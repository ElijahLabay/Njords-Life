	<h1>I Love Flowers</h1>
	<p>Flowers are rare and few. I save them!
Like I said, I have always lived in the city and have floated from place to place, never been tied down.
Living in the city fills me with anxiety, trying to always please other peopleâ€™s needs and be of use. I often 
get overlooked and mistaken for trash.
Because of this I usually walk with a heavy, sunken almost slow pace. I love flying and catching the wind, 
when it blows. People think I have a low almost heavy energy about me, but flowers always bring me so much joy! </p>
